## Descripción
There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/50009/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:50009. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
## Pistas 
There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

Try to think about how the website verifies your login.
